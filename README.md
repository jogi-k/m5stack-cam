# m5stack-cam

* Official Docu from m5stack for timer-cam: https://docs.m5stack.com/en/unit/timercam
* Info for platform-io: https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/espressif32/m5stack-timer-cam.html

What works so far :
* Basically "nothing".
* M5Burner works, I can download the TimerCamRTSP via M5Burner and watch the serial port via Arduino-Monitor, but nothing happens on VLC
* I can compile and download a Hello World in Platform-IO, but it does not print out aything in the monitor of Platform IO.
